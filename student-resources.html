                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crediting sources of knowledge is part of you own development as a scholar and your experience as a university student.<br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a university student, your knowledge is building each term. Each course you take contributes to your overall learning experience. When you write a paper, it is your own original way of looking at a topic. It is a way for you to show what you have learned, so far, about that topic. Your paper might be an analysis, a synthesis, a report, a research paper or an essay. Each of those is a different type of paper, but they all benefit from having sources credited when you write them. When your educators read your paper, they want to know what you have learned about the topic, and where you have learned about the topic. They want to know which books, articles, films and people have influenced your knowledge on the topic.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citing sources in a paper does take some time but it also helps you map out your learning journey - past, present and future. <br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you write a paper for a university course, taking notes is an important part of that process. There are different strategies for keeping track of the quotes and concepts you want to write about. You can use a digital or analog (handwritten, paper) method. <br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever you take notes on an idea or a quote, keep track of the location of the original source. If it was in a video, write down the name of the video and the timestamp of the quote. In a book, note the chapter and page number. <br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Properly citing your sources in your papers is one of the key ways that you can demonstrate evidence of effort put into your work. When I see a paper that has sources properly cited throughout, I know that the writer has taken the time to keep track of the original source for the ideas they wrote about.
