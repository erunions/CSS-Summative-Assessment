                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;APA stands for the American Psychological Association. They are not the only reference style used in University. However, APA style is what is used in most Social Science classes. There is an APA style guide that is published and updated periodically. Students can purchase this style guide, or use the APA website on APA writing style. <br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An APA citation has 3 parts to it: The first part is to cite the author or authors.  The 2nd part of a citation is to include the date they published their work. Finally the 3rd part of the citation is to note the location where you learned this information (page number, paragraph number, timestamp) (APA style website).

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citing your sources is a great way to show respect. By citing sources, you are giving credit and showing appreciation for those who shared knowledge with you.<br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key values in academia is the production or creation of knowledge. We can't learn, if we can't access knowledge from different sources. Our own experiences are sources of knowledge too. There is a big focus, especially in 1st year, on learning from the ideas that have been 'established' by those who wrote and spoke and studied before us. <br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is really important that in our papers, we tell the teacher / professor / instructor, where we learned the facts and information we're writing about. <br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term that is used in academia to discuss how we show respect for knowledge transmission or knowledge sharing, is 'Academic Integrity'. We demonstrate academic integrity by citing the sources where we have learned from. If we have learned something by experiencing it, then we can state that in our papers. <br/><br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our writing we need to distinguish between what we learned from our own experiences, what we learned by observing others around us, what we learned from our textbooks, and what we've learned from other sources.
